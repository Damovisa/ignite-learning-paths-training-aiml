# Show the Build and Release in Progress

## Automating the Manual Process

Talking Points:

* So with those points in mind, let’s look at the build definition:
* Rather than doing it in Jupyter Notebooks (like last demo), let’s make it just the code

Demo :

* Switch to VSCode and show the same code in a pure python file
* In a browser, show the last changed triggered a new “build”, and ran some tasks – focus on the Refresh AML pipeline task
* Show the YAML build definition in VSCode if you like
* Switch to the ML UI and show the AML Pipeline that ran, drill in and see the tasks that ran and show stats
* Show the new model that got produced
